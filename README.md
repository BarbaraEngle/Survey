# Survey

I have written this code in C# Forms because it is what I learnt while I was studying and I am comfortable with it.  C# Forms runs on the Desktop.
I am learning and practicing newer technology (C# web using ASP.NET Core), but it was better for a test to use what I know best.

Update 5 June 2023:
I have made corrections to the code:
In Form2 I have corrected the validation.
I have added a data picker.

If I had more time, I would have added the functionality to add the records to a database.
